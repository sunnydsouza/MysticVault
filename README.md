## üìú Description

Welcome to **MysticVault**, the magical realm where your digital secrets are guarded under the cloak of advanced encryption. Whether it's personal diaries, family photos, or your stash of ancient spells, **MysticVault** ensures that your private files remain just that‚Äîprivate.

## üîí Encryption Details

**MysticVault** uses AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) with a 256-bit key, the same standard used by governments and security agencies worldwide for top-secret information. This means your files are encrypted with a robust, highly secure cipher technique.

### How It Works:
1. **Encryption**: Files are encrypted using a unique key derived from your password combined with a cryptographic salt to enhance security. This process transforms your files into a format that can't be understood without the key.
2. **Decryption**: To access your files, the same password is required to decrypt them back to their original state.

## üîß Installation Instructions

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sunnydsouza/MysticVault.git
   ```
2. Navigate into the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd MysticVault
   ```
3. Install dependencies (don't worry, it's just a sprinkle of digital magic):
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Launch MysticVault and start securing your files:
   ```bash
   python run.py
   ```

### üöÄ Usage

After installing and launching **MysticVault**, the Flask server will be served by default at:

```
http://localhost:5000
```

Navigate to this URL in your web browser to access the MysticVault interface.

### Encryption & Decryption Process:

- **Encryption**: Once you select files for encryption, they will be converted into `.sef` format, and their names will be scrambled to ensure privacy. The original files will be replaced by these encrypted versions in the specified directory.
- **Decryption**: To revert your files to their original state, select the encrypted `.sef` files within the application and enter your password. Successful decryption will restore the original files with their original names and remove the encrypted versions.

### üê≥ Running MysticVault with Docker

Using Docker, you can easily deploy MysticVault without worrying about manually setting up the environment and dependencies. Here‚Äôs how you can run MysticVault using Docker:

1. **Build the Docker Image**:
   ```bash
   docker build -t mysticvault .
   ```

2. **Run MysticVault**:
   To run MysticVault in a Docker container and mount a volume for encryption, use the following command. Replace `/path/to/your/folder` with the path to the directory containing the files you wish to encrypt or decrypt.

   ```bash
   docker run -p 5000:5000 -v /path/to/your/folder:/app/data mysticvault
   ```

   This command does the following:
   - `-p 5000:5000`: Maps port 5000 of the container to port 5000 on your host, allowing you to access the server via `localhost:5000`.
   - `-v /path/to/your/folder:/app/data`: Mounts your target directory to the `/app/data` directory inside the container. Ensure that MysticVault is configured to access this directory for file operations.

## üåü Distinguishing Features

- **Simple as Pie**: With a user interface cleaner than your grandma's kitchen, encrypting files is as simple as pie. ü•ß
- **Files/Folder Support**: Encrypt individual files or entire folders with a single click.
- **Progress Bar/Error Logging**: Keep track of the encryption/decryption process with a handy progress bar and error logging.
- **Docker Support**: Run the app in a Docker container for added security and portability. Can work alongside Plex, Sonarr, Radarr, and other media servers.
- **Photo Friendly**: Got photos? Keep all those memories safe from the nosy parkers!
- **No PhD Required**: You don't need to be a rocket scientist or a cryptographer to use the app. If you can click a button, you're good to go!
